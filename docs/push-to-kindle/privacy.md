title: Privacy Policy
---

The privacy of your data is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

This policy applies to [Push to Kindle](https://www.fivefilters.org/push-to-kindle/).

# What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

## Identity & access

Depending on the Push to Kindle services you use, we may ask for the following information:

* Your Kindle email address (used when Kindle email sending is enabled - these are not stored on our servers after sending completes)
* Your public Patreon profile to determine if you have an active subscription (for additional sending credits).

If you are a subscriber (Patreon or Google Play), we do not link your account to the articles you send or the Push to Kindle email addresses you enter. We use Patreon’s OAuth service if you login with Patreon. We request the minimum information we can using their API. We only use the data returned by Patreon to tell us which tier you’re on, which determines the number of credits you get assigned when using the app.

We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

## Billing information

Push to Kindle is a free service with sending limits. To increase or remove the limits, we offer subscriptions via Patreon and Google Play. Your credit card is passed directly to the payment processor and doesn't go through our servers. All payment data is stored either by Patreon or Google Play, not by us.

## Geolocation data

We use rate limiting to prevent abuse of the system. The rate limiting system relies on IP addresses accessing the service. These are stored for a short time and are then discarded.

## Mobile and web app interactions

We do not currently use third-party web analytics software on the web app or iOS app.

We use Crashlytics in the Android app to catch errors and help us improve the app. Read the [Crashlytics and App Distribution Data Processing and Security Terms](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics-app-distribution-data-processing-terms).

Unless you only use the download links in the web app, we rely on Amazon's Personal Documents Service to deliver your articles to your Kindle account. 

## Cookies and Do Not Track

In the Push to Kindle web app, we use persistent first-party cookies and the browser's local storage to store certain user preferences. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: [allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

## Voluntary correspondence

When you write to us with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.

## Information we do not collect

We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities.

# When we access or share your information

Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or share your info are:

**To provide products or services you've requested.** We do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties. The third-party services we use are [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/rechtliches/impressum) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/). Having subprocessors means we are using technology to access your data. We don't look at your data for these purposes unless an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them from reoccurring. We also use some other processors for other business functions: [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy-and-data-protection/) for support.

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser.


## Location of site and data

Our servers are located in Germany. But please be aware that we rely on Amazon's personal documents service to delivery articles to your Kindle account. As such, any information you provide to us could be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

## Changes & questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices.

Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information? Please get in touch by emailing us at help@fivefilters.org and we’ll be happy to answer them!
